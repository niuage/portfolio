I'm a developer who moves comfortably between game development and web development, and I genuinely enjoy the contrast between the two.

In games, I work mostly in Unity, building gameplay systems, tools, and mechanics that feel responsive and intentional. I like digging into how things feel to play, then backing that up with clean, well-structured code.

On the web side, I build full-stack applications, from backend logic to front-end interfaces.

Outside of work, I spend a lot of time biking and swimming, and I'm generally happiest around sun, water, and good food.
