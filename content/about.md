I'm a developer who moves comfortably between game development and web development, and I genuinely enjoy the contrast between the two.

In games, I work mostly in Unity, building gameplay systems, tools, and mechanics that feel responsive and intentional. I've worked on a voxel engine, a kart racing game inspired by CTR, a platforming game, and many
more prototypes that I've yet to release!

On the web side, I build full-stack applications, from backend logic to front-end interfaces, mostly for work,
but also for fun.

When not in front of the screen, I spend time biking and swimming, and I'm generally happiest around sun, water, good food and my sweet family and friends.
