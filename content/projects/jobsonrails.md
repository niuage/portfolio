description: "Social Platform & Page Builder Built with Ruby on Rails"
---

A social platform built with Ruby on Rails that combined page creation with social networking features. Users could build rich pages with galleries, file attachments, comments, and labels. It had a profile system, search, and a clean sidebar with favorites and collections. The interface was inspired by the social web era — comments, avatars, nested replies, and page-level permissions all baked in.
