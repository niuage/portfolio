description: "Block-Based Robot Builder with Physics & Locomotion in Unity"
---

My first major project in game development — a block-based robot builder where you assemble creatures and robots from modular parts and watch them come to life. The system featured a physics-driven locomotion engine where the assembled body would figure out how to walk based on its structure. Robots were built from voxel-like blocks with joints and limbs, and the terrain included deserts and water environments. Early design sketches show the physics thinking — trajectories, surface interactions, and character mechanics. It was the project that kicked everything off.
