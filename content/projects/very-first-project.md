I'm fairly certain this is the first thing I did after opening Unity for the first time.

I was trying to understand how to animate characters with spritesheets,
how to handle the animation state machine, how to fake height with 2d projectiles etc.

The trajectory of the projectiles is screwed up, but to this day, I don't understand why.
