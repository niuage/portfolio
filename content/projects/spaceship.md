description: "Crowdsourced Shipping Platform"
---

Spaceship was a crowdsourced shipping platform — the idea was to let regular travelers carry packages for others along their route, making deliveries cheaper and faster. Think of it as ride-sharing but for parcels. The branding was bold and minimal with a clean logo that combined an upward arrow with a downward one, representing the send-and-receive flow. It was a startup concept that explored the peer-to-peer logistics space.
