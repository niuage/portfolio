description: "Isometric Cartoon City Environment for the CHKN Game"
---

An isometric city environment built for CHKN, the creature-building sandbox game. The scene features cartoon-style buildings with bold outlines, colorful vehicles, parks, fountains, and waterfront areas. Everything was designed in a cel-shaded art style with strong shadows and a warm palette. It was a departure from the usual open-terrain environments in CHKN, exploring what a more urban setting could look like in the game's universe.
