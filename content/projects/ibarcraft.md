A platform for organizing and discovering Barcraft events — public gatherings at bars and venues to watch competitive eSports like StarCraft and League of Legends. It featured a global map with pinned events, filtering by game and date, and integration with Facebook for importing events. The goal was to make it easy for anyone to find or set up a local viewing party for major tournaments.
