description: "Top-Down Shooter with Procedural Levels via Wave Function Collapse"
---

A top-down shooter where every level is procedurally generated using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. The WFC system assembles stone structures, pathways, and environmental features on desert terrain with palm trees, creating unique layouts each run. Gameplay features enemies, projectiles, explosions, and a health system. The interesting part was getting WFC to produce levels that are not just visually coherent but also fun to navigate and fight through — a balance between algorithmic generation and playable design.
