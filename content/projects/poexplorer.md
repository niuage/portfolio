---

PoExplorer was an item search and trading tool for Path of Exile. It let players filter weapons, armor, and other gear by league, type, rarity, and specific stat requirements. The interface was built for power users — you could set minimum values for stats, toggle online-only results, and sort by price. It pulled data from the game's trade API and presented it in a clean, scannable list with item icons and detailed stat breakdowns.
