description: "Minecraft-Style Voxel Engine & Map Editor Built in Unity"
---

A custom voxel engine built in Unity with a full-featured map editor. The engine renders Minecraft-style block worlds with terrain, lava, water, trees, and stone structures. The editor includes a palette system for different block types, brush tools with variable sizes, and specialized tools for painting, removing, adding blocks, and placing roads. Worlds can be built from scratch or modified in real-time. It was an ambitious deep-dive into voxel rendering, chunk management, and building an editor UI that makes world-building fast and intuitive.
