description: "Low-Poly Desert Scene with Pyramids, Trees & a Campfire"
---

A low-poly 3D scene set in a warm, minimalist desert. Pyramids rise in the background while a small campfire crackles along a winding path, surrounded by simple geometric trees and boulders. A lightning bolt splits the sky above. The whole thing uses a soft pink-and-sand color palette with clean geometric shapes — the kind of scene that's more about mood and composition than polygon count. It was an exercise in low-poly environmental storytelling.
