description: "Building Devpost (ChallengePost) — Hackathon & Software Project Platform"

I worked as a Ruby on Rails developer at ChallengePost (later renamed Devpost), the platform where developers showcase software projects and compete in hackathons. I helped build core features like user profiles with project portfolios, social feeds with follow systems and activity updates, hackathon winner spotlights, and project discovery with likes and comments. The platform grew to become the go-to destination for online hackathons and developer communities worldwide.
