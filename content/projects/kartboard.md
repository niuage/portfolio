description: "Cardboard-Themed Kart Racing Game Built in Unity"
---

A kart racing game where everything is made of cardboard. The vehicles were modeled in Blender with a corrugated cardboard texture and hand-crafted details — engines, seats, wheels, and decals all looking like they were cut and glued together from boxes. The tracks feature winding roads, ramps, water sections, trees, and colorful scenery in a playful low-poly style. The whole concept was built around the visual gag of racing serious-looking tracks in vehicles that look like craft projects. Inspired by the charm of cardboard aesthetics in games.
