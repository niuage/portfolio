Path of Maps was a tool for Path of Exile players to plan and track their endgame map runs. It displayed detailed map information — quantity, rarity, pack size, quality bonuses, monster modifiers, and estimated completion time. Players could organize their maps, see which ones were most profitable, and plan efficient atlas strategies. The interface used color-coded cards and stat breakdowns to make complex endgame decisions quick and visual.
