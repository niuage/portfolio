A collection of illustrated environments I've worked on, mostly isometric dioramas and game-ready scenes with a hand-drawn line art look.

The Japanese temple piece is a small island diorama with a pagoda, a wooden dock stretching over the water, and a torii gate half-submerged near the shore. I wanted it to feel like a little self-contained world you could pick up and put on a shelf.

The pirate cove is a bigger scene, same isometric slice idea but more detailed. There's a skull carved into the cliff face, a ship anchored in the bay, and palm trees scattered across both landmasses. This one took a while to get the water depth looking right.

The tropical ruins are from a top-down game environment built in Unity. Palm trees, broken stone walls, old fences, scattered rocks along a sandy beach. These were designed as modular pieces that tile together for larger maps.

The flooded city is a different direction entirely. I just wanted to experiment with a shader that pixellized models. Not really line art but wasn't deserving of its own entry :p
