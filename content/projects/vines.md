description: "Procedural Vine Growth System on 3D Surfaces in Unity"
---

A procedural vine growth system built in Unity. Vines crawl organically across 3D surfaces — spheres, cubes, and other geometry — branching and spreading based on the surface normals and curvature. Each vine node is placed dynamically, creating natural-looking tendrils that wrap around objects. It was an experiment in procedural generation and surface-aware growth algorithms, the kind of system that could add life to any 3D environment.
