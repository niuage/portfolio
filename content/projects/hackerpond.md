description: "Social Platform for Developers to Share Projects & Join Hackathons"

HackerPond was a social platform built for developers, designers, and makers. The idea was simple: give hackers a place to showcase their projects, discover what others are building, follow each other, and find hackathons to compete in. The site featured project cards with likes and comments, hackathon listings with prize details and registration, and community profiles. It had a playful frog mascot and the tagline "We're all hackers." It was a community-first take on the developer portfolio space.
