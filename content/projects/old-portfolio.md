description: "Previous Personal Portfolio with Low-Poly Art & Dark Theme"
---

A previous iteration of my personal portfolio site. It featured the "NIUAGE" branding on a dark background with a striking low-poly purple cat illustration as the centerpiece. The navigation was minimal — My Work, About, Contact — and the whole aesthetic leaned into bold purple accents against black. The header illustration was designed in Illustrator, and a second version explored a low-poly mountain landscape with pyramids, trees, and water in a moody dark palette.
