A quiz platform with a chat-based interface that made answering questions feel conversational. Players could explore quizzes across categories like entertainment and cinema, track their progress across questions, and share results on social media. The chat panel gave hints and feedback in real-time, making it more engaging than a typical form-based quiz. It also had collections, favorites, and player profiles.
