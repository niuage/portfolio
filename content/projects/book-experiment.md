description: "Top-Down Illustrated Game with a Hand-Drawn Storybook Aesthetic"
---

An experiment in building a game that looks and feels like flipping through an illustrated book. The world is viewed from above with a hand-drawn, sepia-toned art style — trees rendered as fluffy ink clusters, paths sketched as faint trails, and buildings assembled from loose pen strokes. Everything was built in Unity but designed to feel like it belongs on parchment. The goal was to explore what a playable storybook might look like, with interactive elements scattered across a richly detailed map.
