description: "3D Robot Rigging & Walk Cycle Animation in Blender"
---

A mechanical robot model rigged and animated in Blender. The project focused on building a proper bone armature for a multi-legged robot, getting the inverse kinematics right so the legs would plant and lift convincingly. The walk cycle had to account for the weight and mechanical constraints of each joint. It was a great exercise in understanding how real locomotion translates to 3D animation.
